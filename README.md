# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
In this capstone project, we use data science tools to predict if a Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. This information will be used to develop competitive flight pricing for the fictional rocket company space Space Y - headed by founder and CEO, Allon Mask.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches cost 62 million dollars while other providers cost up to 165 million dollars each. Much of the cost savings is because SpaceX can reuse the rocket's first stage. Therefore, to determine the cost of a launch, we will calculate the proability of a first stage landing. This can in turn be used against alternate company bid against a SpaceX rocket launch. In this repository, we find an overview of the space market, data sources, key metrics and the tools used to predict first stage outcomes.

Here, we will be provided with an overview of the problem and the tools we need to complete the project.
To understand the key conditions when a first stage most likey to land successfully, the project will train a machine learning model and public information
