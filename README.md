# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
In this capstone project, we use data science tools to predict if a Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. This information will be used to develop competitive flight pricing for the fictional rocket company space Space Y - headed up by founder Allon Mask.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches cost 62 million dollars while other providers cost up to 165 million dollars each. Much of the cost savings is because SpaceX can reuse the rocket's first stage. Therefore we calculate the proability of a first stage landing to determine the cost of a launch. This can in turn be used against alternate company bid against a SpaceX rocket launch. In this repository, you will find with an overview of the problem and the tools used to predict first stage outcomes.

To understand when a first stage most likey to land successfully, the project team will train a machine learning model and public information
