# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
In this capstone project, we use data science tools to predict if a Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. This information will be used to develop competitive flight pricing for the fictional rocket company space Space Y - headed up by founder Allon Mask.

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches cost 62 million dollars while other providers cost up to 165 million dollars each. Much of the cost savings is because SpaceX can reuse the rocket's first stage. Therefore we calculate the proability of a first stage landing to determine the cost of a launch. This can in turn be used against alternate company bid against a SpaceX rocket launch. In this repository, you will find with an overview of the problem and the tools used to predict first stage outcomes.

To understand when a first stage most likey to land successfully, the project team will train a machine learning model and public information 

According the Space Foundation, the global space industry was worth approximately $447 billion in 2020.  Industry analysts estimate, SpaceX generated over $2 billion in revenue in 2020 at an estimated 40% profit.  Over time, SpaceX has innovated Falcon 9 rocket and operational features (see figure 1).  SpaceX is the only company that employs re-usable rocket hardware and is their core value of their business model.  

We use “Foundational Methodology for Data Science”(John Rollins, SDS IBM). It consists of five phases: Frame the problem, Collect the data, Explore the data, Model the data, and Communicate the results - the methodology is iterative. A supervised classification model using machine learning pipelines, when tuned and refined, we found Logistic Regression predicted historical landings Falcon 9 boosters with 0.94 accuracy rate (see details figure 2.). We use this to be confident of the key features and outcomes for SpaceY Tiercel rocket program.

Findings from our study of key rocket features, program resources and target financials necessary for competitive business as an alternate supplier, SpaceY must meet the following:
  
  Payload Capacity - engines capacity of 22,800 kg to LEO and 8,300 kg to GTO orbits. 
 
  Rocket Reuse - landing legs and grid fins, thermal protection system, avionics systems for reusability, reliability, and maintainability. 
  
  Operational Facilities  -  lower latitude, oceanside launch sites with close landing proximities. And close road /rail networks for effective movement of   mission hardware, near to key human resources and suppliers.
  
  Pricing – with rapid re-use model of operations SpaceY Tiercel missions must be a maximum of $62 million for each flight.
